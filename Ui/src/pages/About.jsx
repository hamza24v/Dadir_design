          At Dadir Design, we're not just about furnitureâ€”we're about the stories that unfold in your living spaces. 
          Our journey began with a vision to offer personalized furniture assembly and craftsmanship that turns houses into homes. 
          Rooted in tradition yet innovating for today, we're proud to serve Columbus and its surrounding communities with the same 
          dedication and attention to detail that have been our trademarks for years. From cherished family heirlooms to contemporary pieces, 
          each project at Dadir Design is more than a task; it's our passion.
